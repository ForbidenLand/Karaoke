00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.400
She's got a smile it seems to me

2
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.400
Reminds me of childhood memories

3
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.000
Where everything

4
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.600
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky

5
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.500
Now and then when I see her face

6
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.300
She takes me away to that special place

7
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.300
And if I'd stare too long

8
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.500
I'd probably break down and cry

9
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.800
Oh, oh, oh

10
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.100
Sweet child o' mine

11
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh

12
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.800
Sweet love of mine

13
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.800
She's got eyes of the bluest skies

14
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.900
As if they thought of rain

15
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.600
I hate to look into those eyes

16
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.600
And see an ounce of pain

17
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.900
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place

18
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.100
Where as a child I'd hide

19
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.200
And pray for the thunder

20
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.700
And the rain

21
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.900
To quietly pass me by

22
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.500
Oh, oh, oh

23
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.900
Sweet child o' mine

24
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh

25
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.600
Sweet love of mine

26
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.900
Oh, oh, oh, oh

27
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.500
Sweet child o' mine

28
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh

29
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.800
Sweet love of mine

30
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.900
Where do we go?

31
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.800
Where do we go now?

32
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.800
Where do we go?

33
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.700
Oh, oh

34
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.400
Where do we go?

35
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.400
Where do we go now?

36
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.100
Where do we go now?

37
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.800
Where do we go?

38
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.300
Where do we go now?

39
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.000
Where do we go now?

40
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.800
Where do we go?

41
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.600
Where do we go now?

42
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.300
Where do we go?

43
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.100
Where do we go now?

44
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.800
Where do we go?

45
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Where do we go now?

46
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.900
No, no, no, no, no, no

47
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.800
Sweet child,

48
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.900
Sweet child of mine

49
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:49.900
